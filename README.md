# My Current Neovim Setup

The current setup is geared toward general development. Weâ€™re primarily working with TypeScript and Python codebases, but the configuration is flexible enough to be extended to other languages.

Also wanted to keep the experience close to what VS-Code provides for me on a regular basis.

Using these plugins for the best experience:

- Lazy Package Manager
- LSP Zero
- Telescope
- Copilot
- Harpoon
- Undo Tree
