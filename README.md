# My Current Neovim Setup

Currently working with lots of Typescript / Javascript codebases. 
This nvim setup is geared towards working with these kinds of codebases.

Also wanted to keep the experience close to what VS-Code provides for me on a regular basis.

Using these plugins for the best experience:

- Lazy Package Manager
- LSP Zero
- Telescope
- Copilot
- Harpoon



---

todo:
- Configure hotkey assistance
- Add debugger
- Configure tmux plugin
